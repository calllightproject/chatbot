    "gas pains": """
    Gas Pains: A buildup of gas in the intestines and constipation are common problems especially after cesarean birth.
    You want to keep your bowels moving, so walk around as often as you can.
    Eat foods that are high in fiber and drink plenty of water.
    To minimize gas pains: walk, rock, or lie on your left side, drink warm fluids often, avoid carbonated drinks, and avoid foods that give you gas.

    "moving after cesarean": """
    Moving After Cesarean Birth: When you get out of bed, roll to your side and use your top arm to push yourself up.
    Sit on the side of the bed for a minute before you get up to make sure you're not dizzy.
    Place a pillow over your incision while you cough or move around in bed.
    If you have stairs at home, try to limit the number of times you go up and down them.
    """,
    "incision care": """
    Incision Care: If you had a cesarean birth, your incision may be closed with staples, stitches, wound closure strips, or surgical glue covered by a sterile dressing.
    Your outer dressing may be removed before you leave the hospital or during a follow up visit with your provider.
    Wound closure strips come loose on their own after 7 - 10 days and then you can remove them.
    You may want to use a clean gauze over your incision, especially if the skin on your belly folds over it.
    Remember to always wash your hands before and after touching your incision.
    It's important to check your incision daily to make sure it's not infected. Some people find it helpful to stand in front of a mirror or use a hand-held mirror to check.
    Each time you clean your incision, make sure to use a clean freshly washed cloth. Otherwise, you're at risk for infection.
    Clean it by washing with warm water and soap. Do not scrub it. Use a clean towel and gently pat dry.

    Call your healthcare provider immediately if your incision is: red, separated, warm to touch, tender or painful, draining, or not healing.

    "bathing your baby": """
    Bathing Your Baby: Once you're home, it may be easier to give your baby sponge baths at first.
    Simply use a warm, damp washcloth to wash and dry their face, body, and diaper area-in that order.
    You may prefer to give your newborn a swaddle immersion bath. When compared to sponge bathing, swaddle immersion is recommended because it is safe, well tolerated, keeps your baby warmer, reduces crying, and helps newborns feel calm and quiet.
    To do a swaddle immersion bath: Put 3-4 inches of warm water in the sink or baby bathtub, wrap your baby loosely in a lightweight blanket, place the wrapped baby in the water to about shoulder level, then unwrap each limb individually, wash, rinse, and cover back up.

    "bathing tips": """
    8 Tips for bathing your baby:
    1. Have all supplies nearby.
    2. Water temperature should be about 100°F. Keep the room warm, about 74°F.
    3. Support your baby's neck and thigh when placing them in the tub.
    4. Wash the face first, then the body and diaper area.
    5. Clean all the folds and creases.
    6. Use a cup to rinse the baby.
    7. Never leave the baby alone in the tub.
    8. Bathe the baby 2-3 times a week.
    """,
    "jaundice": """
    Jaundice: Jaundice is common in newborn babies, giving their skin and the whites of their eyes a yellow color.
    It is typically caused by a buildup of a substance called "bilirubin" in the baby's blood and skin.
    Your baby's bilirubin level may be tested by a light meter on the skin or a blood sample from their heel.
    Treatment typically involves phototherapy, where your baby is placed under a special light or on a fiberoptic blanket.
    """,
    "when to call about jaundice": """

    """,
    "umbilical cord": """
    Umbilical Cord: Your baby's umbilical cord will look shiny and yellow immediately after birth. As it dries, it may appear brown, gray, or purplish-blue. Before it falls off, it will darken like a scab.
    """,
    "cord care": """
    Cord Care: Always wash your hands before touching the umbilical cord, fold the diaper down below the cord, don't put any ointments or creams on it, and if it gets dirty, wash with warm water and pat dry.
    If the area around the cord looks red, is draining, smells bad, or has not fallen off by the third week, talk to your baby's health care provider.
